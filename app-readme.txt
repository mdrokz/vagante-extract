Vagante data.vra extract/repack tool

Last updated for Vagante 1.011.3, tested on Windows and Mac versions

To use, drag data.vra onto vagante-extract.exe. A "data" folder will be created.

The file "repack-list.txt" saves the order in which files will be repacked. You probably shouldn't edit this or the game will likely not load.

To repack, drag the data folder onto vagante-extract.exe, and data.vra will be recreated from it.
